 * Description:
 * This game is arcade side-scroller themed with a leveling system. You gain xp by killing zombies
 * and complete levels by killing the witches.
 * There are three types of zombies:
 * A: Common zombies which take off one health when hit.
 * B: Witches which follow you and kill you instantly.
 * C: The Boss! Faster and stronger version of the common zombie. Just like the
   witch, it will kill you instantly when it touches you.

 This is my first game using java. I plan to convert it to actionScript 3.0 in the future. The game lacks in game mechanics
 and efficient coding but as a first game it's good enough. After I convert it to flash I'll get to work on my next
 project. I'm not sure if I should jump into OpenGL with java or do another 2D java game. Depending on how actionscript 3.0
 works out I might do a game in that.
