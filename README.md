 Description:  
 This game is arcade side-scroller themed with a leveling system. You gain xp by killing zombies
 and complete levels by killing the witches.
 There are three types of zombies:    
 A: Common zombies which take off one health when hit.  
 B: Witches which follow you and kill you instantly.  
 C: The Boss! Faster and stronger version of the common zombie. Just like the  
   witch, it will kill you instantly when it touches you.

 
This is my first game using java. It's a simple side scrolling space shooter , made for a TAFE assignment. All the   graphics involved were copyright free and found online. The aim of the project was to design an arcade style game using Java with a team of one , myself.
 
Noted mistakes : 
The mechanics were very problematic. I didn't put enough planning into the difficulty of the game. The animation could have been better but I'm happy with how the animation turned out. In the future I would like to add more diversity into the gameplay. Making it a challenging and exciting game. At the moment it's quite repetitive.  
May this game be the first of many!
